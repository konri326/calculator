# calculator

A simple backend application that can be used for calculating basic values entered by a user.
The aim of this project is to present an ability to use a design pattern named "Strategy".
The pattern allows an object to choose an action while completing a task instead of using one static way.
The basic idea of this pattern is to separate algorithms from a main object. This allows an object to
transmit a behaviour of algorithm of one of the included strategies.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
mvn compile
```
